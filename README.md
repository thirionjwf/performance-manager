# Performance Manager
The performance manager simplifies the collection of performance metrics from a variety of developer tools. It integrates with tools such as Github, Atlassian, Slack, Sentry and Google. The goal is to make performance contracts more transparent for employees, and easier and faster for an engineering manager.
